to create parent directory,with nested folder inside parent directory we use,
mkdir -p parent/child/grandchild folder names

to recursively add multiples files to staging we use,
git add .

add,commit,pull( to take pull from branch if any other team member had pushed their code) and push


we have added files to staging but if we want to remove a file from staging back to working directory then we use git status to know what next,
git reset HEAD filename

if we need to go back to previous commit ie discarding recently made changes needs to be discareded then use git status to know what next,
(to discard chnages in working directory)
git checkout -- filename


to rename filename in git,
git mv currentfilename newfilename (git level changing)-- git understands renaming is done

os level to rename without git, so it is bash command
mv currentfilename new filename----here git understands as old file is deleted and new file is added

git add -A (add all changes to staging area)
